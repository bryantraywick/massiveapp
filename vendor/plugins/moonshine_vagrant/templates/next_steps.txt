If you're seeing this message, that means you've successfully generated a bunch of files!  

Here's what you need to do next:

* Edit config/deploy.rb and add a new stage to 'set :stages' called "vagrant"
* Since we don't want to stomp on existing files, everything we created has ".generated" in the middle of it.  Rename the following files:
  * config/environments/vagrant.generated.rb => config/environments/vagrant.rb
  * config/deploy/vagrant.generated.rb => config/deply/vagrant.rb
  * config/moonshine/vagrant.generated.yml => config/moonshine/vagrant.yml
  * Vagrantfile.generated => Vagrantfile
* Install VirtualBox: http://virtualbox.org
* You need to install Vagrant! http://vagrantup.com - Once it's installed:
  * vagrant box add "lucid64" http://files.vagrantup.com/lucid64.box
* Install dnsmasq. If you have Homebrew (and you should): brew install dnsmasq 
  * Follow the instructions to start dnsmasq and get it to start at boot 
  * You need to make 127.0.0.1 your FIRST DNS server. How you do that depends on your OS.
  * We generated a file called local_dnsmasq.generated.txt. Cut and paste the contents of that file into your dnsmasq config file
  * While you're in there, you should take the primary IP (either the ip of a single box or the haproxy ip address) and make up a domain name. Something like: address=/foo.rm/192.168.50.3 (using the correct IP obviously)
  * Restart dnsmasq.
* Having fun yet?
* Edit config/environments/vagrant.rb and make sure you're not pulling anything from staging you don't need to (like an asset host).
* Edit config/moonshine/vagrant.yml and set a domain (using the .rm TLD) you'll access the site on.
* Edit config/database.yml and add a section for the new vagrant environment - it should talk to whichever host is running the database (probably db1.APPNAME.local.rm)
* Now we should be ready to start everything: vagrant up
* If everything starts up: cap vagrant deploy:setup - which will take a while.
* Now you should do a cowboy deploy to the vagrant stage and see what happens (it sometimes take 2 or 3 deploys to get everything installed).
* If it all worked, you should be able to go to the domain you set up above and it should look like an "empty" version of your app!

Happy vagranting!
